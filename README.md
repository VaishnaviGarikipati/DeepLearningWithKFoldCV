# DeepLearningWithKFoldCV
Exploring deep learning models with K-Fold cross-validation for robust performance assessment
The Models include 
1. importing basic python libraries, data visualisation libraries
2. scikit-learn split function
3. K-Fold Cross Validation
4. scikit-learn module to encode classes into one-hot coding matrix
5. keras module
Pickling/Unpickling Cifar 10 Dataset, PimaDiabetes Dataset and Iris Dataset
Exploratory data analysis
Cleaning Data
One-Hot-Coding, spliting data into Test and Train data
Training the model
Fine Tuning parameters for perforamnce and accuracy
Adding/deleting Nueral layers
Evaluating model with K-Fold cross validation
Models include combinations of Relu, Sigmoid, Softmax activation functions
Dense Layers varying between 8, 16, 32, 64
loss functions include: mean_squared_error, categorical_crossentropy, binary_crossentropy
ADAM Optimizer most of the cases
Final evaluation of test data and observing accuracy accross models for performace and best ressults
